🚀 I am a Software Engineer with +3 years of experience specializing in Software Development.

👨‍💻 Experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic Software-Based projects.

🔍 Well-versed in numerous programming languages including Advanced Python, TypeScript, Go, and SQL. And frameworks including Express, Django, FastAPI, and Flask. And Databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

🏗️ Also, have a Strong background in project management methodologies using Agile (Scrum and Kanban) and Waterfall.

🔧 Beginning my career as a hardware embedded engineer, I quickly developed a passion for robotics creation and programming. My early journey in hardware included active participation in robot competitions, primarily utilizing C. Solving problems in this language was thoroughly enjoyable.

🌐 To broaden my skill set, I transitioned into web development, embracing Python for backend development, and later added TypeScript to my toolkit. This paved the way for my first role in backend development. As an avid learner, I discovered [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) and was drawn to their teaching methodology, which prompted me to tackle learning Go to keep pace with their courses.

🚀 Driven by a pursuit of excellence, I continuously seek roles in large-scale projects with significant impact. I am enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in the world of technology.
